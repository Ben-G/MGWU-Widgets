/**
 * CCNode layout extension.
 *
 * To take advantage of this class, implement layoutChildren method in your CCNode subclasses.
 *
 * CCScene class's contentSize property automatically set to a proper view size in account of orientation changes. 
 * Hence, use parent node's contentSize property instead of [CCDirector winsize] method.
 *
 * In your layoutChildren subclass, make sure you set proper contentSize for your subclasses so that descendant nodes
 * can retrieve that value for their layout.
 *
 * You must call setNeedsLayout to trigger layoutChidren method.

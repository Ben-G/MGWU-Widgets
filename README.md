# MakeGamesWithUs Widgets

This project contains multiple Cocos2D components which can easily be used in many different games. Currently following components are contained:

- *ScoreboardEntry:* A BitmapFont based score display. Can change scores animated
- *LeaderboardLayer:* A simple Highscore-Board. It uses the MGWU Framework to download highscores and displays the personal highscore and the global top ten.

The project provides demo scenes for each component that demonstrate how to use them.

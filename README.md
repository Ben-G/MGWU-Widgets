# MakeGamesWithUs Widgets

This project contains multiple Cocos2D components which can easily be used in many different games. Currently following components are contained:

- *ScoreboardEntry:* A BitmapFont based score display. Can change scores animated
- *LeaderboardLayer:* A simple Highscore-Board. It uses the MGWU Framework to download highscores and displays the personal highscore and the global top ten.
- *CCMenuBlocking:* A CCMenu subclass that swallows all touches
- *PopUp:* A modal Popup (swallows touches). Can be initialized with a display text, a background image and multiple buttons.
- *InputPopUp:* A modal Popup, that allows the user to enter a text.

The project provides demo scenes for each component that demonstrate how to use them.
